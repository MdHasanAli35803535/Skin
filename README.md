Diagnosing skin cancer using MobileNetV2 truncated with Partial Layer Freezing and Feature Fusion


Abstract: 
Skin cancer is the deadly diseases in the world. Mainly three types of skin cancer such as basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma. But melanoma is the dangerous part of three types. Main reasons about skin cancer is Ultraviolet radiation from the sun cases. According to the World Health Organization 132,000 melanoma skin cancers affected every year .Early detection of this lesions may decrease the mortality rate. We are using transfer learning, fine tuning deep learning model to classify skin lesions. In this model we are added two classes like Benign and Malignant. This model trained 80% of training and 20% of validation and accuracy rate is 0.98% .
